<h1>Recursion Algorithms</h1>

A JavaScript implementation of classic recursive algorithms - Fibonacci sequence and Merge Sort.

<h2>Overview</h2>

This project demonstrates the power of recursion through two fundamental computer science problems:

Fibonacci Sequence: Generating Fibonacci numbers using both iterative and recursive approaches

Merge Sort: A efficient sorting algorithm using the divide-and-conquer strategy

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Fibonacci Sequence</h3>

Iterative Implementation (fibs): Generates Fibonacci sequence using loops

Recursive Implementation (fibsRec): Generates Fibonacci sequence using recursion

Returns arrays containing the sequence rather than single numbers

<h3>Merge Sort</h3>

Recursive Divide & Conquer: Splits arrays into smallest units then merges them back sorted

Efficient Sorting: O(n log n) time complexity

Stable Algorithm: Maintains relative order of equal elements
